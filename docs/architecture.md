# Resume AI Agents - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

**Project Name:** Resume AI Agents  
**Goal:** Comprehensive AI-powered interview preparation system that processes interview invitation emails through specialized agents to generate personalized interview preparation guides with company research, interviewer insights, and role-specific guidance.

The system consists of **three core pipelines** that work together to provide comprehensive interview preparation:
1. **Email Pipeline** - Email classification, entity extraction, and memory management
2. **Deep Research Pipeline** - Multi-agent research using Tavily API for comprehensive data gathering
3. **Prep Guide Pipeline** - Personalized interview preparation guide generation with citations

## Integration Layer ðŸ”—

### ðŸ§  Shared Memory Layer:

**Purpose:** Centralized state repository enabling context reuse between unrelated agent runs.

**Includes:**
- **User Preference Registry**: Stores accepted reply-thread styles, preferred persona settings, chain feedback encouragements
- **Interview History Logs**: Recursive events noting topics addressed previously alongside reflection markers or response tone drift tracking
- **Vector Cache Stack**: Pre-filled areas storing common expression patterns pulled from resolved historical outputs


### ðŸ”„ Feedback Loop Controller:
**Purpose:** Retro-influences agent behavior, questions quality, and reinforcement criteria based on outcome markers gathered automagically.
**Feedback Metrics Tracked:**
- Reply success/neglect ratios within interpersonal dialog modules
- Performance scores tagged to items presented in interview matrices
- Proactive research accuracy level testing via attitude-embedded sample quoting tags
- Response rate increases and delays observed in consecutive rounds of scheduled messaging
