# Resume AI Agents - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

**Project Name:** Resume AI Agents  
**Goal:** Comprehensive AI-powered interview preparation system that processes interview invitation emails through specialized agents to generate personalized interview preparation guides with company research, interviewer insights, and role-specific guidance.

The system consists of **three core pipelines** that work together to provide comprehensive interview preparation:
1. **Email Pipeline** - Email classification, entity extraction, and memory management
2. **Deep Research Pipeline** - Multi-agent research using Tavily API for comprehensive data gathering
3. **Prep Guide Pipeline** - Personalized interview preparation guide generation with citations

---

## System Architecture Overview

The system follows a **sequential pipeline architecture** with the Interview Prep Workflow as the main entry point:

```
ÔøΩ Interview Prep Workflow Entry Point
          ‚Üì
üì¨ Email Classification (Interview vs Personal vs Other)
          ‚Üì (if Interview Email)
üîç Entity Extraction + Memory Check (Company, Role, Interviewer)
          ‚Üì (if Not Already Processed)
üî¨ Deep Research Pipeline (Parallel Multi-agent Research)
          ‚Üì

### 5. **Interview Processing Flow** üéØ

**Purpose:** Scanner + Templater fusion to initialize factual capture from email invites and integrate outcome prompts post-conversation.

#### Pipeline Stages:

1. **Entity Extraction Node**: Uses hybrid extraction and OCR methods to pull:

   - Company name
   - All interviewer names
   - Title reference
   - Slot times (to sync with calendar integrations)
   
   Processes both explicit request text and referenced documents if attached directly.

2. **Post-duplication Filtering**:
   Polls local database for existing entries where hashed identifiers match prior communications. If repeat case detected:

   - Applies simple deduplication flag 
   - Recommends suppression or adjustment navigation

3. **Local Store Logger**:
   Mechanism to record conversation outcomes along with:

   - Sentiment tags
   - Idea transfer acceptance/rejection rate
   - Quality of question performance from identified rodlists

4. **Research Initiation Bridge**:
   Calls multiple parallel requests through standard research agents (previously explained).

5. **Question Formulation Loop**:
   After collective research completion, at least four types of cues are interlaced using dynamic prompting templates via LLM:

   - Company-Centric
   - Person-Centric
   - Role-Level
   - Standard Set (STAR-based toolkit)

6. **Final Output Node**:
   Consolidated resource package containing:
   - Full intel summary doc
   - Compiled questions separated into deeper chunks (by concern domain)
   - Interview cards offering flashcard-style rehearsal semantics

All designed to enhance ecosystemically managed readiness rather than temporary per-perception tactics.

## Integration Layer üîó

### üß† Shared Memory Layer:

**Purpose:** Centralized state repository enabling context reuse between unrelated agent runs.

**Includes:**
- **User Preference Registry**: Stores accepted reply-thread styles, preferred persona settings, chain feedback encouragements
- **Interview History Logs**: Recursive events noting topics addressed previously alongside reflection markers or response tone drift tracking
- **Vector Cache Stack**: Pre-filled areas storing common expression patterns pulled from resolved historical outputs

This allows systems to build proficiency organically as it receives continuous signals from developers and users like yourself!

### üåâ Contextual Messaging Belt:

Purpose: Acts as an API layer between subsystems, translating outputs from one component into inputs for another, maintaining data consistency.

**Facilitates:**
- Receipt from social identity generator to textual relay nodes within application drafts and cold starter chains.
- Use of historical context to pre-fill likely next-step responses during feedback sequences
- user centric prompt derivation from role level criteria aligned with current openings offered or resume-derived stepladders.

Set up approximates relay point jumpers with defined priority trails of term usage depending upon receiving component's goal ‚Äî opening angle development vs. tone mimicry in sensible contexts.

### üîÑ Feedback Loop Controller:

**Purpose:** Retro-influences agent behavior, questions quality, and reinforcement criteria based on outcome markers gathered automagically.

**Feedback Metrics Tracked:**
- Reply success/neglect ratios within interpersonal dialog modules
- Performance scores tagged to items presented in interview matrices
- Proactive research accuracy level testing via attitude-embedded sample quoting tags
- Response rate increases and delays observed in consecutive rounds of scheduled messaging

Such insights ultimately redirect ongoing training validations toward refined linguistic vector directions and internal fidelity settings.
