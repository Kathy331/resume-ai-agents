## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Context Decomposer

**Purpose**: Analyzes research data using Chain-of-Thought prompting to extract structured insights.

**Input**: 
```python
ResearchContext(
    interview_id="seeds_001",
    company_name="Dandilyonn SEEDS Program",
    interviewer_name="Archana", 
    role_title="Sustainability Intern",
    research_data={
        "company_research": [...],
        "interviewer_research": [...],
        "role_research": [...]
    }
)
```

**Processing**:
- **Company Analysis**: Mission, values, culture, recent developments, competitive position
- **Interviewer Analysis**: Background, expertise, communication style, interview approach
- **Role Analysis**: Required skills, responsibilities, growth path, typical challenges
- **Theme Detection**: Cross-cutting insights that span multiple categories

**Output**:
```python
insights = {
    "company_insights": {
        "mission_focus": "Environmental sustainability and leadership development",
        "culture_style": "Warm, collaborative, growth-oriented",
        "recent_developments": "50,000 trees planted, 40% carbon reduction",
        "key_values": ["Environmental stewardship", "Mentorship", "Innovation"]
    },
    "interviewer_insights": {
        "background": "5 years program management, Environmental Science Masters",
        "communication_style": "warm_encouraging",
        "interview_approach": "growth_over_perfection",
        "expertise_areas": ["Program management", "Environmental education"]
    },
    "role_insights": {
        "core_responsibilities": ["Environmental projects", "Data analysis", "Community outreach"],
        "required_skills": ["Research", "Communication", "Environmental passion"],
        "growth_opportunities": ["Project leadership", "Sustainability expertise"],
        "typical_challenges": ["Complex environmental data", "Stakeholder coordination"]
    },
    "cross_cutting_themes": ["Sustainability focus", "Growth mindset", "Community impact"]
}
```

### 2. Question Generator

**Purpose**: Generates specialized questions using strategy-aware prompts tailored to different question types.

#### Company-Aware Question Agent
- **Strategy**: Focus on mission alignment and cultural fit
- **Personalization**: Match user interests with company values
- **Examples**: 
  ```
  "What aspects of Dandilyonn's environmental mission resonate most with your personal values?"
  "How would you contribute to the company's goal of planting 100,000 trees by 2026?"
  ```

#### Interviewer-Specific Question Agent  
- **Strategy**: Adapt to communication style and expertise
- **Personalization**: Adjust formality and technical depth
- **Examples**:
  ```
  "Archana emphasizes 'growth over perfection' - can you share an example where you learned from a mistake?"
  "Given your program management background, what questions do you have about project coordination at Dandilyonn?"
  ```

#### Role-Specific Question Agent
- **Strategy**: Technical depth matching position requirements
- **Personalization**: Highlight relevant user skills and experience
- **Examples**:
  ```
  "How would you approach analyzing the environmental impact of a new sustainability initiative?"
  "What methods would you use to engage community members in environmental education programs?"
  ```

#### Behavioral Question Agent
- **Strategy**: STAR method framework (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- **Personalization**: Connect to user's background and target role
- **Examples**:
  ```
  "Tell me about a time you had to research and present complex environmental data to stakeholders."
  "Describe a situation where you worked on a team project with competing priorities."
  ```

### 3. Prep Summarizer

**Purpose**: Organizes questions into structured clusters and generates comprehensive preparation materials.

**Question Clustering**:
```python
QuestionCluster(
    cluster_id="company_seeds_001",
    cluster_name="Company-Aware Questions",
    focus_area="company", 
    questions=[Question(...), Question(...), Question(...)],
    priority_score=0.8,
    estimated_time_minutes=9
)
```

**Success Strategies Generation**:
- **Company Alignment**: "Emphasize your passion for environmental sustainability"
- **Communication Style**: "Match Archana's warm, conversational approach"
- **Key Themes**: "Weave in growth mindset and community impact throughout responses"

**Research Source Compilation**:
```python
sources_used = [
    {
        "title": "SEEDS Program - Environmental Leadership Development",
        "url": "https://dandilyonn.com/seeds",
        "relevance_score": "0.92",
        "category": "company_research"
    }
]
```

## 🎯 Question Generation Strategies

### Strategy-Aware Prompting

Each question type uses specialized prompting strategies:

```python
# Company-Aware Strategy
company_prompt = f"""
Generate questions that test alignment with {company_name}'s mission and values.
Focus on: {company_insights['mission_focus']}
Company culture: {company_insights['culture_style']}
Recent achievements: {company_insights['recent_developments']}
User background: {user_profile.background}
Generate questions that allow the candidate to demonstrate cultural fit and mission alignment.
"""

# Interviewer-Specific Strategy  
interviewer_prompt = f"""
Generate questions tailored to {interviewer_name}'s style and expertise.
Communication style: {interviewer_insights['communication_style']}
Interview approach: {interviewer_insights['interview_approach']}
Expertise: {interviewer_insights['expertise_areas']}
Generate questions that match the interviewer's preferred style and allow discussion of their expertise areas.
"""
```

### Personalization Engine

**User Profile Integration**:
```python
user_profile = UserProfile(
    experience_level="entry",
    skills=["Python", "Environmental Science", "Research"],
    interests=["Climate Change", "Renewable Energy"],
    preferences={
        "question_difficulty": "intermediate",
        "focus_areas": ["environmental_impact", "technical_skills"]
    }
)
```

**Skill Matching Process**:
1. **Extract Required Skills**: From role research and job description
2. **Match User Skills**: Find overlap between user capabilities and role requirements  
3. **Identify Skill Gaps**: Areas where user needs to demonstrate learning ability
4. **Generate Targeted Questions**: Focus on user strengths while addressing gaps

**Example Personalization**:
```
Original: "How would you approach data analysis for environmental projects?"
Personalized: "Given your Python and environmental science background, how would you design a data analysis workflow to track the impact of renewable energy initiatives?"
```

## 🧠 Advanced AI Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Context Analysis Process**:
```
1. **Surface-level Analysis**: What does the research explicitly state?
2. **Deeper Implications**: What can we infer about company culture and expectations?
3. **Connection Points**: How do company, interviewer, and role insights connect?
4. **Strategic Insights**: What unique angles should the candidate consider?
5. **Question Opportunities**: What questions would demonstrate deep understanding?
```

### Multi-Source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Research Integration**:
- **Company Sources**: Official website, news articles, press releases, culture pages
- **Interviewer Sources**: LinkedIn profiles, speaking engagements, published articles
- **Role Sources**: Job descriptions, team structure, project requirements
- **Cross-Reference**: Identify consistent themes and potential contradictions

### Memory-Augmented Generation

**Caching Strategy**:
```python
# Cache frequently used patterns
company_type_cache = {
    "sustainability_company": {
        "common_values": ["Environmental impact", "Community engagement"],
        "typical_questions": ["Environmental passion", "Systems thinking"],
        "success_indicators": ["Concrete examples", "Long-term thinking"]
    }
}

# Similarity checking for optimization
if similarity_score > 0.8:
    # Use cached patterns with personalization
    questions = adapt_cached_questions(cached_pattern, user_profile, specific_context)
else:
    # Generate new questions from scratch
    questions = generate_fresh_questions(context, user_profile)
```

## 📊 Quality Assessment

### Context Quality Indicators

```python
quality_indicators = {
    "company_coverage": 0.92,      # Completeness of company research
