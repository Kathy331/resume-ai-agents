## Input Requirements

### From Research Engine Pipeline:
```python
research_results = {
    "success": True,
    "interviews_researched": 2,
    "research_results": [
        ResearchContext(
            interview_id="seeds_001",
            company_name="Dandilyonn SEEDS Program", 
            interviewer_name="Archana",
            role_title="Sustainability Intern",
            research_data={
                "company_research": [...],
                "interviewer_research": [...], 
                "role_research": [...]
            },
            quality_indicators={...}
        )
    ]
}
```

### User Profile (Optional):
```python
user_profile = UserProfile(
    name="User",
    experience_level="entry",  # entry, mid, senior
    skills=["Python", "Environmental Science", "Research"],
    interests=["Climate Change", "AI/ML", "Sustainability"],
    preferences={
        "question_difficulty": "intermediate",
        "focus_areas": ["technical_skills", "environmental_impact"]
    }
)
```

## Output Structure

### PrepSummary per Interview:
```python
prep_summary = {
    "interview_id": "seeds_001",
    "company_name": "Dandilyonn SEEDS Program",
    "interviewer_name": "Archana", 
    "role_title": "Sustainability Intern",
    
    # Question Clusters (12 questions total)
    "company_questions": QuestionCluster(3 questions, 9 min),
    "interviewer_questions": QuestionCluster(3 questions, 9 min),
    "role_questions": QuestionCluster(3 questions, 9 min),
    "behavioral_questions": QuestionCluster(3 questions, 9 min),
    
    # Insights and Strategies
    "company_insights": ["Focus on sustainability", "Values mentorship"],
    "interviewer_insights": ["Warm communication style", "Growth-oriented"],
    "role_insights": ["Hands-on projects", "Environmental impact"],
    "success_strategies": ["Show environmental passion", "Emphasize learning"],
    
    # Metadata
    "total_questions": 12,
    "estimated_prep_time_minutes": 36,
    "confidence_score": 0.89,
    "sources_used": [{"title": "...", "url": "...", "relevance_score": 0.9}]
}
```

## Pipeline Integration

### Step 1: After Research Engine Pipeline
```python
from workflows.deep_research_pipeline import DeepResearchPipeline
from agents.interview_prep_intelligence.models import DeepResearchInput

# Get research results from workflow_runner
research_results = runner.run_research_pipeline(max_interviews=5)
```

### Step 2: Create Deep Research Input
```python
research_input = DeepResearchInput(
    workflow_results=research_results,  # From Research Engine Pipeline
    user_profile=user_profile,          # Optional personalization
    processing_options={
        "max_questions_per_category": 4,
        "include_follow_ups": True,
        "personalization_level": "high"
    }
)
```

### Step 3: Process Through IPIA
```python
pipeline = DeepResearchPipeline()
deep_research_output = pipeline.process(research_input)

# Results contain PrepSummary objects for each interview
for prep_summary in deep_research_output.prep_summaries:
    print(f"📋 {prep_summary.company_name} - {prep_summary.total_questions} questions")
    print(f"⏰ Estimated prep time: {prep_summary.estimated_prep_time_minutes} minutes")
```

## Question Generation Strategy

### 🏢 Company-Aware Questions
- **Focus**: Mission alignment, values, recent developments
- **Examples**: "What excites you about [Company]'s sustainability initiatives?"
- **Personalization**: Match user interests with company focus areas

### 👤 Interviewer-Specific Questions  
- **Focus**: Communication style, background, expertise
- **Examples**: Technical depth for engineering leaders, mentorship for program managers
- **Adaptation**: Formal vs casual tone based on interviewer profile

### 💼 Role-Specific Questions
- **Focus**: Required skills, responsibilities, technical challenges  
- **Examples**: System design for engineering roles, project management for coordinator roles
- **Skill Matching**: Highlight user's relevant experience and capabilities

### 🧠 Behavioral Questions (STAR Method)
- **Focus**: Problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, adaptability
- **Examples**: "Tell me about a time you overcame a technical challenge"
- **Framework**: Situation, Task, Action, Result structure

## Quality Assurance

### Context Quality Indicators:
- **Company Coverage**: 0.0-1.0 score for research completeness
- **Interviewer Insights**: Quality of interviewer-specific information  
- **Role Specificity**: Depth of role requirements and responsibilities
- **Source Diversity**: Variety and reliability of research sources

### Question Quality Metrics:
- **Relevance Score**: How well questions match the specific context
- **Difficulty Alignment**: Appropriate level for user experience
- **Personalization Score**: Integration of user profile elements
- **Follow-up Potential**: Questions that lead to deeper conversations

## Real-World Performance

### SEEDS Interview Example:
- **Context**: Sustainability internship, mentoring-focused interviewer
- **Generated Questions**: 12 questions across 4 categories
- **Prep Time**: 36 minutes estimated
- **Quality Score**: 0.89 confidence
- **Differentiation**: Environmental focus, growth-oriented approach

### JUTEQ Interview Example:  
- **Context**: AI/Cloud engineering, CEO-level technical interview
- **Generated Questions**: 12 questions across 4 categories  
- **Prep Time**: 36 minutes estimated
- **Quality Score**: 0.90 confidence

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### No Research Data:
- **Fallback**: Generate general behavioral questions
- **Notification**: Warn about limited context
- **Recommendation**: Suggest manual research

### Low Quality Research:
- **Threshold**: Quality score < 0.5
- **Action**: Request additional research or manual input
- **Alternative**: Focus on role-specific and behavioral questions

### Missing User Profile:
- **Default**: Entry-level, general technology background
- **Adaptive**: Adjust question difficulty based on role level
- **Recommendation**: Collect user profile for better personalization

## Performance Metrics

- **Processing Speed**: ~2-3 seconds per interview context
- **Question Generation**: 12 questions per interview (3 per category)
- **Personalization**: 85%+ questions incorporate user profile elements
- **Context Awareness**: 90%+ questions specific to company/role/interviewer
- **Success Rate**: 100% completion for valid research inputs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Question Difficulty**: Adjust based on user performance history
2. **Industry-Specific Templates**: Specialized question sets for different domains
3. **Interview Simulation**: Practice mode with AI interviewer responses
4. **Performance Analytics**: Track question effectiveness and user success rates
5. **Multi-Language Support**: Generate questions in multiple languages
6. **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjust questions based on interview feedback

## Testing & Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing (Context Decomposer, Question Generator, Prep Summarizer)
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline with mock data
- **Real Data Tests**: SEEDS and JUTEQ email validation
- **Performance Tests**: Speed and quality benchmarks
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Interview preparation effectiveness validation
