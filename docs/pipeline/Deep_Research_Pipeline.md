## Tavily Cache Integration

### Cache Management
- **Location**: `cache/tavily/`
- **Structure**: JSON files with query hashes as filenames
- **Expiration**: Time-based cache expiration for fresh data
- **Optimization**: Automatic cache cleanup and optimization

### Cache Statistics
- Use `python workflows/cache_manager.py --status` to view cache health
- View cached queries, file count, and storage size
- Monitor cache hit rates and API usage optimization

### Research Quality Reflection

**Purpose**: Validate research adequacy before proceeding to guide generation.

**Quality Checks**:
- **Information Completeness**: Verify all required data points are covered
- **Source Reliability**: Validate information sources and credibility
- **Data Freshness**: Check for recent and relevant information
- **Coverage Depth**: Ensure sufficient detail for personalized preparation

**Decision Logic**:
- **Adequate**: Proceed to Prep Guide Pipeline
- **Insufficient**: Trigger additional research loop with targeted queries
- **Missing Critical Data**: Flag gaps and conduct focused follow-up research

## Output Format

The Deep Research Pipeline outputs comprehensive research data:

}
```

## Pipeline Integration

### Step 1: After Research Engine Pipeline
```python
from workflows.deep_research_pipeline import DeepResearchPipeline
from shared.models import DeepResearchInput

# Get research results from workflow_runner
research_results = runner.run_research_pipeline(max_interviews=5)
```

### Step 2: Create Deep Research Input
```python
research_input = DeepResearchInput(
    workflow_results=research_results,  # From Research Engine Pipeline
    user_profile=user_profile,          # Optional personalization
    processing_options={
        "max_questions_per_category": 4,
        "include_follow_ups": True,
        "personalization_level": "high"
    }
)
```

### Step 3: Generate Interview Preparation Guide
```python
pipeline = DeepResearchPipeline()
deep_research_output = pipeline.process(research_input)

# Results contain comprehensive interview preparation guides
for guide in deep_research_output.prep_guides:
    print(f"📋 {guide.company_name} - Preparation Guide Generated")
    print(f"⏰ Research completed with comprehensive insights")
```

## Question Generation Strategy

### 🏢 Company-Aware Questions
- **Focus**: Mission alignment, values, recent developments
- **Examples**: "What excites you about [Company]'s sustainability initiatives?"
- **Personalization**: Match user interests with company focus areas

### 👤 Interviewer-Specific Questions  
- **Focus**: Communication style, background, expertise
- **Examples**: Technical depth for engineering leaders, mentorship for program managers
- **Adaptation**: Formal vs casual tone based on interviewer profile

### 💼 Role-Specific Questions
- **Focus**: Required skills, responsibilities, technical challenges  
- **Examples**: System design for engineering roles, project management for coordinator roles
- **Skill Matching**: Highlight user's relevant experience and capabilities

### 🧠 Behavioral Questions (STAR Method)
- **Focus**: Problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, adaptability
- **Examples**: "Tell me about a time you overcame a technical challenge"
- **Framework**: Situation, Task, Action, Result structure

## Quality Assurance

### Context Quality Indicators:
- **Company Coverage**: 0.0-1.0 score for research completeness
- **Interviewer Insights**: Quality of interviewer-specific information
