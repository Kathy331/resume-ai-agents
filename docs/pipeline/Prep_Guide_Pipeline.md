## Output Generation

### Guide Structure

The generated preparation guide follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
# Interview Preparation Guide: [Company Name]

## 📋 Before the Interview
[Company overview, preparation points, logistics]

## ⚙️ Technical Preparation  
[Role-specific technical content and requirements]

## 👤 Interviewer Background
[Professional backgrounds and expertise areas]

## ❓ Strategic Questions to Ask
[Personalized questions for the interviewer]

## 📚 Citations and Sources
[Full source references and research backing]
```

### Filename Generation

**Keyword Extractor Integration**: Uses `agents/keyword_extractor/agent_email.py` to generate company-based filenames.

**Filename Format**: `[company_name].md`
**Storage Location**: `outputs/fullworkflow/[company_name].md`

### Terminal Display

The complete preparation guide is displayed in the terminal before storage, allowing users to review the content immediately.

## OpenAI Cache Integration

### Cache Management
- **Location**: `.openai_cache/`
- **Purpose**: Cache guide generation requests to reduce API costs
- **Optimization**: Reuse similar guide structures and common content

### Performance Benefits
- Reduced API calls for similar companies or roles
- Faster guide generation for cached content
- Cost optimization for repetitive preparation patterns

## Individual Processing

### Email-Specific Output
- Each email processed individually through the complete pipeline
- Separate preparation guides for each company/interview
- No batch processing - ensures focused, personalized content

### Output Organization
- Individual files prevent information mixing
- Clear separation of preparation materials
- Easy access to specific interview preparations

## Quality Assurance

### Content Validation
- Research-backed recommendations with citations
- Source verification for all personalized conclusions
- Comprehensive coverage of preparation areas

### Personalization Accuracy
- Role-specific technical content alignment
- Interviewer background accuracy verification
- Company-specific cultural and strategic insights

## Error Handling

- **API Failures**: Retry logic with cached fallback
- **Missing Research Data**: Graceful degradation with available information
- **File Storage Issues**: Alternative storage paths and error logging
- **Citation Errors**: Source validation and error reporting

## Integration Points
