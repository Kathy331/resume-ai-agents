# Interview Prep Guide Generation Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the structured approach for generating comprehensive, research-backed interview preparation guides that provide actionable insights with proper citations and validation systems.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Research-Driven Content**
- All recommendations must be backed by specific research findings
- Include proper citations with clickable links
- Validate information through multiple sources
- Use reflection loops to identify and fill information gaps

### 2. **Structured Format Consistency**
- Follow the 8-section framework outlined below
- Use emoji icons for visual organization
- Provide specific, actionable bullet points
- Include timeline-based preparation steps

### 3. **Personalization Requirements**
- Tailor content to specific company, role, and interviewer
- Include candidate-specific talking points
- Adapt technical focus based on job requirements
- Reference interviewer's background and interests

## Minimum Viable Guide (MVG) Threshold

### Purpose
Not all interviews will have abundant data available. The MVG defines the absolute minimum acceptable standard for a prep guide after 3 reflection loops. If these thresholds aren't met, the system will provide specific warnings about information gaps.

### MVG Criteria (Must achieve ALL to pass)

### Fallback Strategies for Missing Information

#### **When Company Information is Limited**
1. **Industry-Standard Approach**: Use role-based technical preparation
2. **Generic Company Research**: Focus on publicly available information
3. **Competitor Analysis**: Research similar companies in same space
4. **Role-Focused Strategy**: Emphasize technical competencies over company specifics

#### **When Interviewer Information is Unavailable**
1. **Team-Based Preparation**: Research the team/department generally
2. **Role-Based Questions**: Focus on position-specific inquiries
3. **Company Culture Focus**: Prepare questions about team dynamics
4. **Technical Leadership Angle**: Assume technical discussion focus

#### **When Recent Company News is Scarce**
1. **Historical Context**: Use older but significant company milestones
2. **Industry Trends**: Connect company to broader industry movements
3. **Product Focus**: Deep dive on company's main products/services
4. **Market Position**: Analyze competitive landscape thoroughly

### Automated MVG Assessment

#### **Post-Reflection 3 Checklist**
```python
def assess_mvg_compliance(prep_guide):
    mvg_score = {
        'critical_sections': check_critical_sections_complete(),
        'citation_count': count_working_citations(),
        'company_specificity': assess_company_specific_content(),
        'recent_info': count_recent_information(),
        'actionable_questions': count_specific_questions(),
        'technical_alignment': assess_technical_relevance()
    }
    
    if mvg_score['total'] < MVG_THRESHOLD:
        return generate_specific_warnings(mvg_score)
    else:
        return approve_for_delivery(prep_guide)
```

#### **Warning Generation Logic**
- **Critical Failure**: < 50% of MVG criteria met ‚Üí Block delivery
- **Quality Concerns**: 50-70% of MVG criteria met ‚Üí Deliver with warnings
- **Acceptable Quality**: 70-85% of MVG criteria met ‚Üí Minor advisory notes
