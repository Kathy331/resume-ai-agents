## Implementation Notes

### For AI Generation
1. Always trigger reflection loops when information gaps are detected
2. Prioritize recent, specific information over generic industry knowledge
3. Use company engineering blogs, recent press releases, and interviewer social media for insights
4. Validate all generated links before inclusion
5. Ensure each section provides genuine value beyond basic research

### For Quality Assurance
1. Test all citation links for accessibility
2. Verify interview logistics accuracy
3. Check that technical preparation matches actual job requirements
4. Ensure questions couldn't be answered by a simple website visit
5. Confirm timeline recommendations are realistic

This framework ensures every interview prep guide is research-backed, highly personalized, and immediately actionable for the candidate's success.
