print("""
1. ðŸ“Š CHECK TRAINING DATA BALANCE:
   - Run the analysis function in train_ner.py to see entity distribution
   - Ensure you have roughly equal examples for each entity type

2. ðŸ“ˆ ADD MORE TRAINING DATA:
   - Collect 20-50 examples for each entity type
   - Diversify the phrasing and context for each entity

3. ðŸ”„ IMPROVE TRAINING:
   - Increase n_iter from 30 to 50-100 epochs
   - Add entity type analysis to see what's missing

4. ðŸŽ¯ EXAMPLE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
   - DURATION: More variations (30-min, 1-hour, 45 mins, etc.)
   - DATE: Different formats (August 25, Monday, Oct 1, 2025-11-05)
   - ROLE: Various job titles (Data Scientist, CTO, Senior Developer)
   - COMPANY: Different company name styles
   - FORMAT: Various meeting formats (Zoom, virtual, in-person)
   - LOCATION: Different location references
   - INTERVIEWER: Various interviewer titles and names

5. ðŸš€ QUICK TEST YOUR MODEL:
   - Test with sentences that contain multiple entity types
   - If some entities are never detected, you need more training examples for those types
